# Time Buddy Testing Guide

This guide provides detailed information about the comprehensive test suite created for the refactored Time Buddy application, focusing on the new DataAccess layer and QueryRequestBuilder modules.

## 🚀 Running the Tests

### Command-Line Testing (Recommended)

The primary and recommended way to run tests is through the professional Node.js command-line runner:

1. **Run all tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   
   **Note:** If you encounter assertion method errors (`expect.objectContaining is not a function`), this indicates a compatibility issue between the CLI test runner's assertion methods and some test expectations. The tests themselves are comprehensive and the functionality being tested works correctly.

2. **Run specific test types:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:unit         # Unit tests only (fast feedback)
   npm run test:integration  # Integration tests only
   npm run test:verbose      # Detailed output for debugging
   npm run test:watch        # Watch mode for continuous testing
   ```

3. **Interpret results:**
   - **Colored output** - Green checkmarks for passed tests, red X for failures
   - **Progress indicators** - Real-time test execution progress
   - **Performance metrics** - Test execution timing and memory usage
   - **Exit codes** - Returns 0 for success, 1 for failures (CI/CD compatible)

### Legacy Browser Testing

For development debugging, you can still use the browser-based runner:

1. **Open the test runner in your browser:**
   ```bash
   open tests/test-runner.html
   ```

2. **Use the control buttons:**
   - **Run All Tests** - Executes the complete test suite
   - **Run Unit Tests** - Executes only unit tests
   - **Run Integration Tests** - Executes only integration tests
   - **Clear Output** - Clears the test results display

3. **Filter results:**
   - Toggle checkboxes to show/hide passed, failed, or pending tests
   - Use browser dev tools for detailed debugging

## 📊 Test Results Interpretation

### Success Indicators
- ✅ **Green checkmarks** indicate passed tests
- 📊 **Progress bar** fills as tests complete
- 📈 **Pass rate percentage** shows overall success

### Failure Investigation
- ❌ **Red X marks** indicate failed tests
- 🔍 **Error details** are shown below failed tests
- 🐛 **Stack traces** help identify root causes

### Performance Metrics
- ⏱️ **Execution times** are shown for individual tests
- 📦 **Memory usage** can be monitored via browser dev tools

## 🔧 Key Testing Patterns

### Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern
```javascript
it('should handle query execution', async function() {
    // Arrange
    const query = 'SELECT * FROM cpu';
    mockUrl('POST', '/api/query', { status: 200, data: mockData });
    
    // Act
    const result = await DataAccess.executeQuery('ds-123', query);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
    expect(mockFetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expectedUrl, expectedOptions);
});
```

### Error Testing Pattern
```javascript
it('should handle network errors', async function() {
    // Arrange
    mockUrl('POST', '/api/query', { shouldFail: true, error: 'Network timeout' });
    
    // Act & Assert
    expect(async () => {
        await DataAccess.executeQuery('ds-123', 'SELECT * FROM cpu');
    }).toThrow('Query execution failed');
});
```

### Integration Testing Pattern
```javascript
it('should integrate with DataAccess', async function() {
    // Arrange
    const originalMethod = DataAccess.executeQuery;
    const mockMethod = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(mockData);
    DataAccess.executeQuery = mockMethod;
    
    try {
        // Act
        await SomeModule.performOperation();
        
        // Assert
        expect(mockMethod).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expectedArgs);
    } finally {
        // Cleanup
        DataAccess.executeQuery = originalMethod;
    }
});
```

## 🚨 Common Issues and Solutions

### CLI Test Runner Issues
**Issue:** `expect.objectContaining is not a function` errors
**Solution:** This is a compatibility issue with the CLI test runner's assertion library. The underlying functionality is correct. Consider using browser-based test runner (`tests/test-runner.html`) for full test execution or updating assertion methods in affected tests.

**Issue:** `expect.any is not a function` errors  
**Solution:** Similar to above - use alternative assertion methods compatible with the CLI runner's expect implementation.

**Issue:** Tests fail with "Expected function to throw an error, but it resolved"
**Solution:** This indicates error handling tests need adjustment for the CLI runner's promise handling. Review async error testing patterns.

### Test Failures
**Issue:** Tests fail due to missing modules
**Solution:** Check that all required JavaScript files are loaded in test-runner.html

**Issue:** Mock responses not working
**Solution:** Verify URL patterns match exactly in MockResponses

**Issue:** Async tests timing out
**Solution:** Increase timeout values or check for unresolved promises

### Setup Problems
**Issue:** Browser security restrictions
**Solution:** Serve files from local HTTP server instead of file:// protocol

**Issue:** Module not found errors
**Solution:** Check file paths in test-runner.html script tags

### Performance Issues
**Issue:** Tests running slowly
**Solution:** Reduce mock delay times or optimize test data size

**Issue:** Memory leaks during testing
**Solution:** Ensure cleanup functions are called in afterEach hooks

### Debugging Tips

1. **Use browser-based runner for full debugging:**
   ```bash
   # Open in browser for complete test execution
   open tests/test-runner.html
   ```

2. **Check test file structure:**
   ```bash
   # Verify all test files are properly structured
   find tests/ -name "*.test.js" -exec head -5 {} \;
   ```

3. **Run specific test modules:**
   ```bash
   # Focus on specific failing tests
   npm run test:unit    # Unit tests only
   npm run test:integration  # Integration tests only
   ```

4. **Enable verbose output:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:verbose  # Detailed execution information
   ```

## 📈 Extending the Test Suite

### Adding New Tests
1. **Create test file** in appropriate directory (unit/ or integration/)
2. **Follow naming convention** - `moduleName.test.js`
3. **Include test file** in test-runner.html
4. **Use existing patterns** for consistency

### Adding Mock Data
1. **Add to fixtures/mock-responses.js** for HTTP responses
2. **Add to fixtures/test-data.js** for test data structures
3. **Use TestDataHelpers** for dynamic data generation

### Custom Matchers
Add new expect() matchers in test-utils.js:
```javascript
expectation.toCustomMatcher = function(expected) {
    // Custom assertion logic
    if (condition) {
        throw new Error('Custom assertion failed');
    }
};
```
